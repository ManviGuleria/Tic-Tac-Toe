#Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C++
This repository contains a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in C++ as a console-based application. The game allows two players to play against each other in real-time, taking turns to place their symbols (X and O) on a 3x3 grid.

Features :
Two-player gameplay: Play alternately as Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O).
Input validation: Ensures valid moves and prevents overwriting occupied positions.
Game status updates: Displays the board after every move and announces the result (win, draw, or continue playing).
Easy to use: Simple user interface with numbered positions for ease of input.

Rules of the Game :
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Players take turns to enter their symbol (X or O) in an unoccupied cell.
The first player to get three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins.
If all cells are filled and no player achieves the winning condition, the game is declared a draw.

Code Overview :
Main Logic: Handles the game loop, user inputs, and determines the game's status.
Game Board: Manages the grid, displays the board, and checks for wins or draws.
Validation: Ensures players only make valid moves
